Discrete Element Model used for the publication Campmans \& Wijnberg 2022 in Aeolian Research



This is the code used to generate the model simulations presented in the paper "Modelling the vertical grain size sorting process in aeolian sediment transport using discrete element method" by G.H.P. Campmans and K.M. Wijnberg 2022



Use of the model is allowed, as long as the paper and repository are cited. Also see the LICENSE file.



The paper is available via:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2022.100817

Repository: 

https://github.com/CampmansGHP/AeolianGrainSizeSortingDEM.git



Use of the model:

An example model run has been provided in the file:

example\_call\_particle\_model.m



If one would like to generate a simulation themselves, one would need to coppy and modify the example run folder, including the input function to the specific input file that is desired.
